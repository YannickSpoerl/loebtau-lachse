								<h2>Our founding story</h2>
								<p>It was the year 2021, when a fatefull encounter began to shift the entire future of Löbtau. In one of Löbtaus most famous shared apartments did Hannah Lankowsky, currently
									back-to-back Team-Captain, bring a Frisbee into the apartment. What would start as a nice pastime would soon become an unique success-story rarely witnessed before.
									Day after day more people showed up, always led by "The WG" to play Frisbee. While the established members would bring their Frisbee-Skills to perfection,
									the story spreaded that there was a new Frisbee-Team in the Region. The message even reached until Leipzig and after most recent times, we are able to call us
									an international Frisbee-Team due to a norwegian member! Every week more people join us and you could be the next!
								</p>

								<h3>The story continues!</h3>
								<p>You think all the frisbeen were thrown already? No way! Our number of members doubles every month, we play in both the most important
									Frisbee-Leagues in Germany and we are looking forward to our first international matches. The Frisbee is flying faster and faster
									and we can't be stopped now! Spread the message and become a part of our team!
